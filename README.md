# Python-Challenge

 ## Py Me Up, Charlie

## PyBank

In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will give a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)


1. Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:


2. The total number of months included in the dataset


3. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period


4. The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period


5. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


6. The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
